FineDyne allows users to choose a restaurant in Toronto in a holistic manner based on various constraints. Currently, it is implemented for Toronto and uses data from the Yelp dataset challenge.

It uses dc.js, dc-leaflet.js, crossfilter.dj to allow users to interact with the data and see distributions of restaurants depending on category of food, price range, and quality of restaurant.

Use chrome to open FineDyneSrc/index.html to see the html code.
web/js/fdComponents.js is the main javascript file.
css/style.css is the main css file.
